		<h1 align="center" style="color: #310707 ;">The Art of Fashion</h1>
		<p align="center" style="color: black;">" Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the creation of clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, and jewellery of different cultural aesthetics and their mix and match into outfits that depict <br>distinctive ways of dressing (styles and trends) as signifiers of social status, self-expression, and group belonging. As a multifaceted term, fashion describes an industry, styles, aesthetics, and trends. "</p>

		<p align="center">Although this is the technical definition of " fashion " I say its <strong>incomplete</strong>	. I will explain further more, but,</p>
		<h2 style="color: #250505 ">Reasons why I'm into fashion</h2>

		<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
			<li>Fashion made my image to myself more pleasing.</li>
			<li>With fashion finding my image more pleasing this led to self Confidence.</li>
			<li>This helped me express myself more.</li>
			<li>And it has helped me be more open.
		</ul>
		<h3 style="color: #250505">My personal take on fashion's definition</h3>
		<p align="center"><mark>Fashion is an art</mark>, it's just <strong>another way of communication</strong>. Because style isnt just to throw on clothes and call it day, It's to <strong>express yourself</strong>, fine-tune your <strong>craft in your own style that compliments you</strong>. The people around you can inspire, the people around you can strike conversations just based off of your outfits because they believe its nice. Fashion is something that helped me gain back confidence in myself aswell as acknowledge when its the right time to dress up for occassions. So once again Fashion isn't just clothes, jewelry, it's all the things that I've stated and the reason why I grew into this catalog of art. If you could go up to anyone thats into fashion you can ask them if their sense of fashion has improved their self-esteem, they will say yes. </p>

		<p>Honestly, another factor to add is how I genuinely learned how to sew stitches, crop the hems on pants, shirts, make fitted items, and whatnot. The skills I've honed actually saved me <strong>a lot of money and time</strong> by having to not go to a tailor when I can just do it at home. I also find it peaceful you know, It's nice just listening to music and crafting something that'll be 1 of 1 just for you to fit to your liking. This emphasizes the " craft " of fashion and it can <strong>really bring out the differences</strong> in styles to really <strong>spark that uniqueness and creativity</strong> that people can <strong>express through clothing and their imagination</strong>.</p>

		<h1 align="center" style="color: #310707 ">Fashion is subjective, and will continue to be, as we can all show ourselves through it.</h1>
